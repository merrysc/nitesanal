Note: This is a code repository for some basic analysis for specific psychometric experiments, for the purpose of isolating errors or bugs. It's public to allow binderising. If unfortunately you've found yourself on this page by keyword search I'd advise you to keep looking. Solutions out there, but not here and it can't be trusted ;)


Code currently implements sklearn package, on review statsmodels give more informative information. So am in the middle of switching (again) and will provide confidence levels when done.

Sample data is from one individual who I have absolute rights to use but who unfortunately isn't very good at the task ;)

Starting to split the files for later functioning, collated's output needs changing (it's also using prior PSE, though no real difference).
