Code currently implements sklearn package, on review statsmodels give more informative information. So am in the middle of switching (again) and will provide confidence levels when done.

Sample data is from one individual who I have absolute rights to use but who unfortunately isn't very good at the task ;)

Starting to split the files for later functioning, collated's output needs changing (it's also using prior PSE, though no real difference).
